# GenZ Ed

An interative web application for helping the students with their queries while learning.

In this application, the educator can upload a learning material in the form of text or a document(pdf) as data source. The students would be able to access this document and ask their queries in a chatbox, powered by GPT-3. Further, the students can request a summarised form of the data, which would again be fetched using a GPT-3 API.
